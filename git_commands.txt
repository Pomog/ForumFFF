1. To sync your local main branch with the remote one, discarding local changes, using git fetch and git reset --hard. 
But be cautious: this overwrites local changes with the remote branch's state.
```bash
    git fetch origin main
    git checkout main
    git reset --hard origin/main
```

2. To update your local den_dev branch with changes from the main branch, you can merge or rebase main into den_dev.

```bash
    git checkout den_dev
    git merge main
```This command incorporates changes from the main branch into your den_dev branch.

```bash
    git checkout den_dev
    git rebase main
```This command moves the changes made in den_dev on top of the current main, allowing for a cleaner history.
